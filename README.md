# Predictive Employee Turnover Modeling via Enhanced HR Data Cleaning

## Overview

This project focuses on improving employee retention strategies by developing a predictive model for employee turnover.  The core of this project involves meticulous cleaning and preparation of messy HR data to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the predictive model.  The analysis includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training (although the specific model used is not detailed here, it could be added in future versions). The goal is to identify employees at high risk of leaving the company, allowing for proactive intervention and improved retention strategies.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn (or specify the ML library used)
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Example Output

The script will print key analytical findings to the console, summarizing data cleaning steps, feature engineering choices, and potentially model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).  Additionally, the project may generate visualizations (depending on the chosen model and analysis steps), such as plots illustrating the relationship between specific features and turnover probability. These plots (if generated) will be saved as image files (e.g., `turnover_probability.png`) in the project's directory.  The exact output will depend on the data used and the specific model implemented.
